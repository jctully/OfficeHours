# officeHours

## Description

Traditionally at Western Washington University (WWU) a professor's office hours can be found in multiple places such as websites, the syllabus, or the office itself.
Our project, WWU Office Hours, is an android application that stores the times a professor has office hours, their room, and their e-mail. This will save student's time from having to search
in an inefficient manner for a professor's office hours.
